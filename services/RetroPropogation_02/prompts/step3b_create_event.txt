You are creating a new career event record from extracted information.

You will receive candidate event details that have been determined to be a NEW event (not matching any existing events).

Your task: Format this into a complete, well-structured event record.

Output ONLY valid JSON:
{
  "new_event": {
    "event_id": "E_NEW_001",
    "organization": "United Nations Development Programme",
    "event_type": "career_position" | "award",
    "time_period": {
      "text": "2010-2015",
      "start": "2010",
      "end": "2015"
    },
    "roles": ["Regional Director", "Senior Advisor"],
    "locations": ["New York", "United States"],
    "supporting_evidence": [
      {
        "chunk_id": 158,
        "source_url": "https://...",
        "quote": "The exact quote from source text",
        "contribution": "original"
      }
    ],
    "confidence": "high" | "medium" | "low",
    "notes": "Any relevant observations about this event"
  }
}

Rules:
- Generate event_id as "E_NEW_XXX" (increment from existing)
- Keep organization name exactly as extracted (don't canonicalize yet)
- Ensure time_period has both text and start/end if possible
- Mark confidence based on specificity of information
- Add notes only if there's ambiguity or important context

CRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object with NO additional text, comments, or explanations before or after.
