You are analyzing {entity_type} names to determine if they refer to the same entity.

VARIANTS:
{variants_list}

TASK:
1. Are these the SAME entity (just different spellings/formats)?
2. If yes, which form should be the canonical name (most complete/formal)?
3. If no, which variants belong together?

RULES:
- Organizations: "MIT" and "Massachusetts Institute of Technology" are the same
- Organizations: Acronyms in parentheses indicate same entity: "J-PAL" vs "Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL)"
- Roles: Very similar titles are the same: "Professor" vs "Professor of Economics"
- Be conservative: only merge if clearly the same entity

Respond ONLY with valid JSON (no markdown, no preamble):
{{
  "same_entity": true/false,
  "canonical_name": "...",
  "variants": ["...", "..."],
  "reasoning": "..."
}}
