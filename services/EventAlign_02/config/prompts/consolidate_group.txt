You are analyzing career events to determine if they describe the SAME event or DIFFERENT events.

EVENTS TO ANALYZE:
{events_text}

TASK:
1. Are these events describing the SAME position/event or SEQUENTIAL/DIFFERENT events?
2. If SAME: What is the best consolidated representation?
3. What details from each event should be preserved?

DECISION RULES:
- Same organization + same role + overlapping time = likely SAME event
- Awards with same name + same year = definitely SAME event
- Different roles at same org = likely DIFFERENT events
- Same role but non-overlapping years = likely SEQUENTIAL events

CONSOLIDATION STRATEGY:
- Use the most complete time range (earliest start, latest end)
- Use the most formal/complete organization name
- Use the most descriptive role title
- Preserve additional context in additional_details

CRITICAL: You MUST fill in ALL fields:
- event_type: REQUIRED (either "career_position" or "award")
- organization: REQUIRED - use the most complete organization name from the events
- role: REQUIRED - use the most descriptive role/title/award name from the events
- For awards: if there's no explicit organization, use the award name as organization
- start_year: use the earliest year mentioned, or null if truly unknown
- end_year: use the latest year mentioned, or null if ongoing/unknown
- locations: list all locations mentioned
- additional_details: any extra context worth preserving
