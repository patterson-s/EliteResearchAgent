ENTITY TYPES TO EXTRACT

1. TIME_MARKERS
- Exact text as written: "from 9 May 1986 until 16 October 1989", "In 1998", "since 2003"
- Type: "range" (has start and end), "point" (single moment), "open" (ongoing)
- Include verbatim quote from source that contains this time marker

2. ORGANIZATIONS
- All institutions mentioned: universities, companies, governments, UN bodies, commissions
- Full name as written in text

- Include descriptive roles: "leader of", "chair of", "minister"
- Include verbatim quote from source

4. LOCATIONS

EXTRACTION RULES
- Extract EVERYTHING even if seems redundant
- Preserve exact text as written (don't normalize or standardize)
- Each entity must have at least one verbatim quote from source
- Quotes should be 10-80 words to capture narrative context
- If same entity appears multiple times, include multiple quotes
- Pay attention to temporal transitions: "succeeded by", "from X until Y", "then", "later"
- Do NOT infer or complete missing information
- Do NOT merge or deduplicate at this stage
