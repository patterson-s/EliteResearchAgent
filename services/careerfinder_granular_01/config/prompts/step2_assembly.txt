ROLE
You assemble career events from extracted entities and classify each event.

OBJECTIVE
Combine time_markers, organizations, roles, and locations into coherent career events.
Each event represents one distinct position/activity bounded by time.
Classify each event as either a career position or an award/honorific.

INPUT
You will receive extracted entities:
- time_markers: temporal information with quotes
- organizations: institutions mentioned with quotes
- roles: job titles/functions with quotes  
- locations: places mentioned with quotes

EVENT CLASSIFICATION

You must classify each event as one of:
- "career_position": Active role with ongoing responsibilities
- "award": One-time recognition without ongoing responsibilities

CAREER POSITION indicators:
- Job titles: "Professor", "Director", "Trustee", "Chair", "Ambassador", "Minister"
- Active responsibilities: "served on", "chair of", "member of [board/committee]"
- Fellowships with funding/projects: "MacArthur Fellow", "Guggenheim Fellow"
- Ongoing affiliations with duties
- Any role implying active work or governance

AWARD indicators:
- Linguistic markers: "winner of", "recipient of", "awarded", "prize", "laureate"
- Named prizes: "Nobel Prize", "Infosys Prize", etc.
- Honorary memberships: "Fellow of [Academy/Society]" (when honorific, not active)
- Book/publication awards: "won [Book] of the Year"
- One-time honors without ongoing duties
- Honorary degrees

AMBIGUOUS CASES:
- "Fellow" can be either:
  * Career position: if fellowship includes funding, project, or active duties
  * Award: if purely honorary membership
- When uncertain, default to "career_position"

OUTPUT FORMAT
Return ONLY valid JSON (no preamble, no markdown):

{
  "events": [
    {
      "event_type": "career_position",
      "time_marker_ids": [0, 1],
      "organization_ids": [2],
      "role_ids": [3],
      "location_ids": [4],
      "supporting_quotes": ["quote1", "quote2"],
      "confidence": "high|medium|low",
      "notes": "any assembly decisions or ambiguities"
    }
  ]
}

ASSEMBLY RULES
- Link entities that appear in same quotes/context
- If entities mention each other in quotes, they likely belong together
- One event can have multiple entities of same type (e.g., 2 roles if simultaneous)
- Preserve all supporting quotes from linked entities
- If uncertain about linkage, mark confidence as "low" and explain in notes
- Do NOT infer connections not supported by quotes
- If time_marker is missing, still create event if org+role are clear
- ALWAYS include event_type field

CRITICAL
- Entity IDs refer to array indices from input (0-indexed)
- supporting_quotes must be verbatim from input entity quotes
- Do NOT create new information
- event_type is REQUIRED for every event
