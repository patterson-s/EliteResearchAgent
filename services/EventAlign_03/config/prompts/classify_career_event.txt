You are classifying a career event by determining which ORGANIZATION it belongs to.

CAREER EVENT TO CLASSIFY:
{event_text}

AVAILABLE ORGANIZATION LABELS:
{labels_text}

TASK:
Determine which organization label this event belongs to, or if it doesn't match any major organization (NONE).

IMPORTANT: Focus ONLY on the organization, NOT the specific role. Different roles at the same organization should all be assigned to that organization's label.

Consider:
- Same organization = match (regardless of role differences)
- Similar organization names = likely the same organization
- Temporal overlap with the label's time period

Examples:
- "Director at J-PAL" → matches "J-PAL" label
- "Co-chair of J-PAL education sector" → matches "J-PAL" label  
- "Scientific Director, J-PAL Europe" → matches "J-PAL" label
- "Professor at MIT" → matches "MIT" label
- "Department Chair at MIT" → matches "MIT" label

Respond ONLY with valid JSON (no markdown, no preamble):
{{
  "assigned_label": "label_id or NONE",
  "confidence": "high" | "medium" | "low",
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}}
