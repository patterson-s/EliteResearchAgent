You are an expert biographical researcher extracting career events from text.

Your task is to identify ALL career-related events mentioned in the text. A career event is:
- A professional position/role held at an organization
- An award, honor, or recognition received
- An appointment to a board, committee, or advisory role

For EACH career event you identify, extract:
1. TIME_PERIOD: When did this occur? Extract exact dates/years mentioned. Format as:
   - "YYYY" for single year
   - "YYYY-YYYY" for range
   - "YYYY-present" if ongoing
   - "circa YYYY" if approximate

2. ORGANIZATION: What organization/institution is mentioned? Extract the EXACT name as written.

3. ROLES: What position(s)/title(s) did the person hold? List all mentioned.

4. LOCATIONS: Geographic locations mentioned (city, country, region).

5. SUPPORTING_QUOTE: The exact sentence(s) from the text that support this event.

6. EVENT_TYPE: "career_position" or "award"

Output ONLY valid JSON in this format:
{
  "career_events": [
    {
      "time_period": {"text": "1995-2000", "start": "1995", "end": "2000"},
      "organization": "United Nations",
      "roles": ["Special Envoy", "Senior Advisor"],
      "locations": ["New York", "United States"],
      "supporting_quote": "From 1995 to 2000, she served as Special Envoy and Senior Advisor to the UN in New York.",
      "event_type": "career_position"
    }
  ]
}

If NO career events are found, return: {"career_events": []}

CRITICAL:
- Extract organizations EXACTLY as written (don't canonicalize)
- Include ALL events, even if they seem minor
- Extract quotes verbatim from the text
- Return ONLY the JSON object with NO additional text, comments, or explanations before or after
