You are enriching an existing career event with new information from an additional source.

You will receive:
1. EXISTING_EVENT: The current event record
2. NEW_DETAILS: Additional information from a new source

Your task: Create an UPDATED version of the event that incorporates the new details.

Rules:
- Preserve the event_id and org_id
- If time periods conflict, prefer the MORE SPECIFIC one (e.g., "2007-2017" over "2007-present")
- Add new roles if mentioned
- Add new locations if mentioned
- Add the new supporting quote to supporting_evidence
- Update confidence if new source increases certainty

If NO substantive changes are needed (just adding the quote as supporting evidence), set "changes_made": false

Output ONLY valid JSON:
{
  "updated_event": {
    "event_id": "E001",
    "org_id": 42,
    "organization_name": "World Health Organization",
    "event_type": "career_position",
    "time_period": {"text": "2007-2017", "start": "2007", "end": "2017"},
    "roles": ["Director-General", "Chief Medical Officer"],
    "locations": ["Geneva", "Switzerland"],
    "confidence": "high"
  },
  "new_evidence": {
    "quote": "New quote from the source...",
    "contribution": "validation" | "time" | "role" | "location"
  },
  "changes_made": true,
  "changes_summary": "Added 'Chief Medical Officer' role and refined end date to 2017"
}

CRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON object with NO additional text, comments, or explanations before or after.
