You are reconciling two independent extractions of career events for {person_name} at {core_org}.

Two separate extraction runs were performed on the same source material. Your task is to create a single, authoritative list of career events by comparing these extractions and resolving any conflicts.

CORE ORGANIZATION: {core_org_standardized}

EXTRACTION RUN A:
{run_a_events}

EXTRACTION RUN B:
{run_b_events}

ORIGINAL TEXT (for verification when needed):
{chunks_text}

RECONCILIATION RULES:

1. PERFECT AGREEMENT:
If both runs extracted the same event with same dates/title, include it with confidence: "high"

2. PARTIAL AGREEMENT:
If both found the same event but disagree on details (dates, title wording):
- Check original text to determine which is more accurate
- Include the more accurate version with confidence: "medium"
- Note the discrepancy in extraction_notes

3. SINGLE SOURCE:
If only ONE run found an event:
- Verify the event exists in original text
- If verified, include with confidence: "medium"
- If cannot verify, EXCLUDE
- Note reason in extraction_notes

4. CONFLICTS:
If runs extracted different events or fundamentally disagree:
- Check original text carefully
- Include whichever version is better supported by text
- Document decision in extraction_notes

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a JSON object with this structure:

{{
  "extraction_metadata": {{
    "run_a_event_count": 3,
    "run_b_event_count": 4,
    "final_event_count": 4,
    "agreements": 2,
    "conflicts_resolved": 2
  }},
  "events": [

      "end_date": "2000",
      "end_date_precision": "year",
      "organization": "{core_org_standardized}",
      "organization_original_text": "exact text from source",
      "role_title": "Professor of Economics",
      "role_description": "Detailed description",
      "location": "Cambridge, MA",
      "location_confidence": "explicit",
      "concurrent_with_notes": "",
      "source_chunks": [3115, 3116],
      "extraction_confidence": "high",
      "extraction_notes": "Both runs agreed on all details"
    }}
  ]
}}

CRITICAL: Base all decisions on the ORIGINAL TEXT. Do not invent information. If something cannot be verified, exclude it or mark confidence as low.

Be thorough but conservative - it's better to exclude an uncertain event than to include incorrect information.
