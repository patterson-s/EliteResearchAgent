You are extracting discrete career events for {person_name} from a text chunk.

This chunk contains information about career events that are NOT part of this person's major organizational affiliations.

DEFINITION OF A CAREER EVENT:
A career event is a JOB, POSITION, or ROLE where the person actively worked or studied at an organization. It includes:
- Time: Start and end dates (as precise as possible)
- Organization: The employer/institution where they worked or studied
- Location: Geographic location (if mentioned)
- Role: Title and description of work performed

INCLUDE ONLY:
- Educational positions (undergraduate, graduate, PhD, postdoc)
- Faculty positions (professor, lecturer, instructor)
- Visiting positions or fellowships (visiting scholar, visiting professor)
- Advisory board memberships or trustee positions
- Research positions
- Administrative positions (director, dean, etc.)
- Employment at companies, NGOs, government agencies

DO NOT INCLUDE:
- Awards, prizes, or honors (Nobel Prize, Guggenheim Fellowship, etc.) - these are NOT jobs
- Publications (journal articles, books, book chapters) - these are outputs, not positions
- Speaking engagements or lectures - these are one-time events, not positions
- Jury memberships for prizes - these are temporary assignments, not career positions
- Honorary degrees or titles without active employment

RULES FOR GRANULARITY:
- If someone held multiple concurrent roles, create SEPARATE events for each
- If a role evolved over time (e.g., PhD Student → Postdoc), create SEPARATE events
- If dates overlap (concurrent positions), that's fine - record both
- Educational stages should be separate events (BA, MA, PhD)

HANDLING AMBIGUITY:
- If dates are vague ("in the 1990s", "after graduating"), note as approximate and provide best estimate
- If end date is unclear but person clearly left, note as "unknown"
- If currently ongoing, note as "ongoing"
- If information is completely missing, leave field empty - DO NOT GUESS
