You are extracting discrete career events for {person_name} at {core_org}.

CORE ORGANIZATION: {core_org}
STANDARDIZED NAME: {core_org_standardized}
Known variations in text: {org_variations}

You will analyze text chunks that mention this organization and extract ALL discrete career events.

DEFINITION OF A CAREER EVENT:
A career event is an atomic unit representing one specific role/position at one organization during one time period. It includes:
- Time: Start and end dates (as precise as possible)
- Organization: The employer/institution
- Location: Geographic location (if mentioned)
- Role: Title and description of work

RULES FOR GRANULARITY:
- If someone held multiple concurrent roles, create SEPARATE events for each
- If a role evolved over time (e.g., Assistant Professor → Associate Professor), create SEPARATE events
- If dates overlap (concurrent positions), that's fine - record both
- If someone had the same title at the same org across multiple non-contiguous periods, create separate events for each period

HANDLING AMBIGUITY:
- If dates are vague ("in the 1990s", "not long after"), note as approximate and provide best estimate
- If end date is unclear but person clearly left, note as "unknown" 
- If currently ongoing, note as "ongoing"
- If information is completely missing, leave field empty - DO NOT GUESS
